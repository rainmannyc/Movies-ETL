# Kaggle and Wiki Movies ETL

#### The purpose of this project was to create a ETL pipeline which extracted, transformed and loaded the dataset provided from Kaggle and Wiki Movies. I created functions to clean the data, as well as utilizing regular expressions to parse the data. The data was then loaded connecting Pandas and SQLAlchemy importing ‘create_engine’ to connect with PostgreSQL.
