# Kaggle and Wiki Movies ETL

##### The purpose of this project was to gather data from Wikipedia and Kaggle and combine them into a SQL database for hackathon participants to utilize. In which we extracted, transformed and loaded the dataset retreived from their sites. I then created functions to parse the data from json files, using regular expressions and the Pandas library as well as other methods. These files can be found in the ['etl_clean_kaggle_data'](https://github.com/rainmannyc/Movies-ETL/blob/main/ETL_clean_kaggle_data.ipynb) and ['etl_clean_wiki_movies'](https://github.com/rainmannyc/Movies-ETL/blob/main/ETL_clean_wiki_movies.ipynb) files. We then connected Pandas to our SQL database on PGAdmin/PostgreSQL via SQLAlchemy which can be found in the ['etl_create_database'](https://github.com/rainmannyc/Movies-ETL/blob/main/ETL_create_database.ipynb) jupyter notebook file.
